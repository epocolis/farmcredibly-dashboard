## How to process the farm_gate files

You can run the script by runing: 
```bash
python agricultural_pricing_analytics.py [-h] input_path output_folder
```

**for example:**

```bash

python agricultural_pricing_analytics.py ../data/raw/farmgate_prices_2020_2021/csv/Farmgate\ 08.07.2021.csv ../output

```
A single output file will be written to ../output/august_07_2021/all_august_07_2021.csv
